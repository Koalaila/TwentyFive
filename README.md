# Hi, this is my Twenty Five repo!
This is a work in progress projects that I am developing 25 Projects by the time I graduate in different languages

These languages include:
* Python
* C# 
* Java
* JS/React
* C++
* Rust
* Elixir
* Go

I may not use every one of these languages but I will certainly learn them!

## My Goal:
I want to accomplish the following things
* Learn reverse engineering
* Improve on current skills and learn new skills
* Branch out and build a resume

This probably isn't the most efficient way to do this, but it is the most fun for me and I am still very new, only a sophomore in college.

I will update this part below on the projects I am currently working on!
