# Hi, this is my Twenty Five repo!
This is a work in progress projects that I am developing 25 Projects by the time I graduate

**Every Project I will develop has different personal reasons for making them, and I will try my best to make them as professionally developed as possible but I am very new to coding; the projects are my way of learning**

## My Goal:
I want to accomplish the following things
* Learn reverse engineering
* Improve on current skills and learn new skills
* Branch out and build a resume

This probably isn't the most efficient way to do this, but it is the most fun for me and I am still very new, only a sophomore in college.

I will update this part below on the projects I am currently working on!

-------

1. Weather API - Difficulty: Easy |  **On Hold**
2. Compiler -  Difficulty: Medium-Hard?
3. Encryption Tool -  Difficulty: Medium | **Currently Working on**
